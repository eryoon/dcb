# Hello, JS!

## JavaScript
We're using the JavaScript programming language in this course. JavaScript's natural habitat is in the web browser. It's the code that runs all the interactions on all the websites you visit.

But in recent years, JS has taken steps outside the web browser. It's an incredibly popular programming language, and with tool called [Node](https://nodejs.org), JavaScript can run on your computer just like any other language.

JavaScript files are just text with a `.js` file extension. When these files are fed to Node, Node interprets and executes the instructions inside.

## Visual Studio Code
We use Visual Studio Code as our text editor. VSCode has a lot of built-in tools that will help us write our code, as well as work with Git. There are also several extensions that might prove usefulâ€”especially the one called "Node Exec," which will automatically run our JS from VS Code.

## Our First Program
We teach programming the old-school way here at Mirman. That means beginning at the beginning, with "Hello, World!"
