# DCB
The course repository for Design, Compute, Build at [Mirman School](https://mirman.org)

## ?!: A Dialogue

### What even is this?
This is the starter repository for all the programming exercises we'll be doing in DCB. The code that resides at [https://github.com/mirman-school/dcb](https://github.com/mirman-school/dcb) is considered **upstream**, or "teacher" code.

### "Repository?"
It's where we put stuff. In this case, code.

### What do I do with it?
Start by creating a **fork** of the repository. Look up at the buttons on the top of GitHub. Once you have an account, click that **fork** button when you're looking at this repo. 

### Fork?
Basically you're making a personal copy of this code repository. You don't have permission to upload to the school's repo, but you _do_ have permission to make changes to yours.

### Okay I've forked it. What now?
Code on GitHub is great, but to work on it, you'll need to get that code on your computer. To do this, we're going to **clone** the repository. That just means we download what's on GitHub. There are 3 ways to do this:

1. Download the code with the **download** button on the GitHub page.
2. Use the built-in clone tool in **Visual Studio Code**.
3. Use git from the command line. In terminal, type `git clone ` and the URL of the GitHub repo.

### Whoah. Terminal??
Don't worry. We'll ease you into it.

### Okay, I've cloned. Now what?
Now your code lives in two places: on your computer, and on GitHub. We call the repo on your computer the **local**, and the GitHub one the **remote**.

You're ready to work. The next steps take place inside the folders. Check out the first folder, `1-hello-js` to get started.
